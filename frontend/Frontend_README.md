## NeuroChat Frontend

This is the frontend folder for the NeuroChat project. I designed it to be simple, modern, and user-friendly, with a strong focus on user experience.

### Key Features:

*   **Interactive Chat Interface:** Allows sending and receiving messages from AI models.
*   **Modern and Engaging Design:** I've enhanced the design to be more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing.
*   **Automatic Conversation Scrolling:** The conversation remains visible at all times with automatic scrolling to the bottom when new messages are added.
*   **Fully Responsive:** The interface adapts to various screen sizes (phones, tablets, desktops).
*   **Seamless Backend Integration:** The frontend connects to the NeuroChat backend server via API.

### File Structure:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the interface structure.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file defining the interface's design and appearance.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file managing the interface logic, user interaction, and backend communication.

### How to Run Locally:

1.  **Ensure the Backend is Running:** The NeuroChat backend server must be running on `http://localhost:12000`.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

The frontend will automatically start and connect to the backend for a seamless chat experience.
